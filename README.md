# Rebuild a site!

This is the repository for the Code Fellows CS20 Semantic HTML5 rebuild assignment.

The site I copied is the blog of [Richard Schneeman](http://schneems.com/) and all content is his.  "Schneems" is a developer at the esteemed [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com).

This repo contains: 
*the original site outline obtained from http://gsnedders.html5.org/outliner/ ("original_outline"), 
*a site outline I created ("outline"), 
*and my HTML5 structure ("schneems.html").
